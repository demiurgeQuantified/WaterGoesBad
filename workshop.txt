title=Water Goes Bad
description=This mod makes the water still stored in sinks, baths, etc after the water shutoff become unsafe to drink after a customisable amount of time. Off-grid water containers, such as water dispensers, stored water containers, and player plumbed sinks are not affected.
description=
description=This mod is best used to add extra realism and challenge to singleplayer/co-op survival runs, where stored-up water leaves a near infinite supply of easy safe water even after the water shutoff. Some may find a challenge run with instantly shut-off and tainted water fun, too.
description=
description=Sandbox variables allow you to customise how many days after the water shutoff the water becomes tainted (including instantly). This mod also optionally features these water sources draining over time: the rate of this can be customised in depth.
